this files describe the roadmap, I think should be for the OpenAccess Driver/Parser

- EVERYONE WHO WANT TO CONTINUE THIS WORK SHOULD READ AT LEAST MY REPPORT,
  concept like EMH are really welcome ...

ON THE DRIVER

- first write the driver as mixed for debug purpose : convert AMS device using freePDK45
  xml techno file from hurricane, but use existing OpenAccess files for
  freepdk45 techno, separating technology converting with device
  converting (working on it)

- then check that, layout is working correctly, all components,
  metals, poly ... are present and DRC works without errors.

- then concentrate on how to really get the LSW have the layers (colors), and
  encounter eating converted techno without errors, and add the techno
  convertion ... don't join the techno convertion with device, the
  main reason is design kits : a design kits basicly contain libs for
  techno and libs for cells.

- test with a "small" cpu, like a mips, and some ampli, miller ...

- when and ONLY when the layer is correctly converted totaly, 
  populate symbolic view, to show a rectangle with input on left, and output
  on right.

- then populate schematic view, to show shematic "device" will be placed
  like in layout.

ON THE PARSER

- first use a mixed mode like for the driver

- convert only analogic because we have no numerical hurricane
  freePDK45 cells.

- see in a pharos, CellViewer like (cf: tests and benchmarks) that 
  the converted hurricane cells are the same

- deal with the layer convertions, masks ... and complete technology conversion
