  *  \section      secMainViewIntro  Introduction
  *
  *                There are two categories of views : the main views and the 
  *                maps. 
  *
  *                The main view provides global or partial display of a cell 
  *                while the map view (which is always attached to a main view) 
  *                visualizes always the globality of the cell (in a simplified 
  *                mode) and furthermore locates the part being currently 
  *                visible within the main view. 
  *

 /*! \function     MainView* MainView::Create();
  *                The default constructor (no cell is yet associated to the 
  *                main view, but the drawing area is created). 
  *
  *                The map is also created as well as its drawing area. 
  *
  *                While the drawing areas are not inserted in a parent widget 
  *                the display is not effective (it is therefore possible to 
  *                activate only the display of the main view).
