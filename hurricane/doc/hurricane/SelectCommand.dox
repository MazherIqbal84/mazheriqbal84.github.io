  *
  *  \section      secSelectCommandIntro  Introduction
  *
  *                This command allows to change the set of occurences selected 
  *                in a view, by either replacing by, adding to or erasing from 
  *                the current selection the occurences located into a 
  *                rectangular area or below a point. This command uses a rubber 
  *                rectangle to define the selection area. Let us recall that a 
  *                cell may have different selections in different views. 
  *
  *                This command has name : <b>"Select"</b> and has to be 
  *                installed on the mouse <b>middle button</b>. 
  * 
  * 
  *  \section      secSelectCommandPrinciple  Principle
  *
  *                After defining a rectangle, the selection proceeds in two 
  *                steps : 
  *
  *                <b>Identification of candidate occurences :</b> 
  *
  *                If the selection rectangle is a point Then the candidate 
  *                occurences are those located below this point. 
  *
  *                Else The candidate occurences are all those located inside 
  *                the rectangle or intersecting the rectangle if the control 
  *                key is hold down. 
  *
  *                Only visible occurences are potentially candidates. Only 
  *                occurences of instances refering a terminal cell are 
  *                potential candidates. 
  *
  *                <b>Modification of the current selection :</b> 
  *
  *                If the shift key is hold down Each occurence is selected 
  *                provided it was not previously selected, and unselected if it 
  *                was previously selected (toggle mode). 
  *
  *                Else The new selection of only the candidate occurences 
  *                replaces the old one (replace mode).
