The stimuli used for the simulation are described in a \verb-Stimuli- method. This method is a Python function generator that is automatically called by the \verb-Testbench- method to generate all the stimuli. As a Python function generator, the \verb-yield- instruction have to be used at the end of each stimuli computation.

\subsubsection{Affect value to signals}
The method \verb-affect- permits to affect a value to a given signal as follow
\begin{verbatim}
self._stim.affect(self.Ck,0)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Add stimuli}
The method \verb-add- permits to finish a step of simulation by add all the values to the current stimuli
\begin{verbatim}
self._stim.add()
\end{verbatim}
